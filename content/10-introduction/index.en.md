# Welcome to the Rancher on AWS Workshop!!

In this workshop, we will be utilzing the Rancher Product Stack on AWS Infrastructure to complete the following workshop modules:
* **Exploring** a Rancher RKE2 Kubernetes cluster.
* **Creating** a Rancher RKE2 Kubernetes cluster.
* **Importing** a existing Amazon EKS Kuberenetes cluster. 

If you're completing this workshop at an official event with Rancher and/or Amazon AWS, your AWS Account will be pre-configured with the required infrastructure. To get started, please head over to the [Workshop Overview](/content/10-introduction/11-workshop-overview/index.en.md).

If you're completing this workshop outside an official event, you will need to configure the required infrastructure, before starting the workshop. Follow the steps [here](/content/10-introduction/12-workshop-environment/index.en.md#for-outside-official-events), then head over to the [Workshop Overview](/content/10-introduction/11-workshop-overview/index.en.md).

# Introduction

**Welcome to the Rancher on AWS Workshop!**

In this workshop, we will be utilzing the Rancher Product Stack on AWS Infrastructure to complete the following workshop modules:
* **Explore** a Rancher RKE2 Kubernetes cluster.
* **Create** a Amazon EKS Kubernetes cluster.
* **Import** a existing RKE2 Kuberenetes cluster.
